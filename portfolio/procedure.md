When a developer mentioned that he didn't understand a feature, I rewrote a topic on using scout lines. This sample is one of the updated procedures. Note that the end user here is very experienced and already familiar with terminology.

# Use scout lines to scroll through images

When a viewport is locked, you can scroll through the images in the stack by dragging the scout line in a scout image.

1. Make sure scout lines are activated. <br/>
If necessary, click ![scout icon](icon_scout.png) on the toolbar.
2. Lock the viewport: click ![scout icon](icon_scout.png) in the viewport. <br/>
When the viewport is locked, the lock icon ![scout locked icon](icon_scout_lock.png) shows. See ![one](icon_1.png) following: <br/><br/>
![viewport locked](image_vp_locked.png)<br/><br/>
3. In a viewport that displays the scout image, click and drag the scout line ![two](icon_2.png) to scroll through the images on the locked viewport (and any linked viewports). <br/>
Note there are two scout images for the locked viewport shown.
4. To remove the lock, click ![scout locked icon](icon_scout_lock.png) in the viewport (![one](icon_1.png)) .
