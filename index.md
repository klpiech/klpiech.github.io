# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub site! I'm Karen Piech, a senior technical writer. I have over 20 years experience documenting a wide variety of applications:  digital evidence review, medical image diagnostics, financial payments, laser movie projector operation, database integration, and mathematics. Along the way, I've learned a little about cloud technologies, Kubernetes and kubectl, APIs (RESTful and SOAP), databases, SQL, HTML, CSS, JSON, and YAML.

Thank you for taking the time to have a look at my technical writing portfolio. I am not able to share writing samples from my previous jobs, so I am using this site to create some. As a bonus, this gives me an opportunity to learn new skills!
