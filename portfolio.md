# [Before and after](/portfolio/before-after.md)

In the user guide for a complex application, we were using callouts to identify and to briefly explain features. Originally, there was a single image with many callouts. 
I thought that if I categorized the callouts and used used multiple images, it would be easier for the user to understand and find information.

# [End user procedure](/portfolio/procedure.md)

When a developer mentioned that he didn't understand a feature, I rewrote a topic on using scout lines.

# [Architecture diagram](/portfolio/arch-diagram.md)

I created an architecture diagram for an application and described the flow of data within it.
